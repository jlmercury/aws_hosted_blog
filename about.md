## About the title
{:.sub-title}

*En partance* is a French expression which refers to the moment of leaving. If someone is *en partance*, it means that he or she is about to leave for a certain place.

I took this phrase from a book [Partir - Le d√©part](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Partir-d%C3%A9part-Jean-Luc-Nancy/dp/2227481811) by a French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, and since I recognized this phrase I've always been wanted to use it as a part of my writing. This site is an outcome.
